# @embroider/app-blueprint

**Very** experimental blueprint for scaffolding Ember v2 apps with Vite

This is likely to change on a daily basis so you have to keep up to date with the changes to expect it work. Use [ember-cli-update](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update) to update to the latest version.

## Usage

```bash
npx ember-cli@latest new my-fancy-app -b @embroider/app-blueprint --pnpm
```
